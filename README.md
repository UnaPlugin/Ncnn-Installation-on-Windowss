# Ncnn-Installation-on-Windows
The steps and tips of installing the ncnn+protobuf envs on Windows.


----
#### Since the guide of installing and building Ncnn on Windows on the Official Site **can't** actually lead me correctly:

  https://github.com/Tencent/ncnn/wiki/cmake-VS2017-%E7%BC%96%E8%AF%91

#### I've found some other resources to build the Ncnn on my computer.
----
## 1: A Standalone Project

  https://github.com/liyemei/ncnn-windows-vs2013
  
This project doesn't rely on the envs. All the resources of the 3rd party are included in the project.

But it relys on the **VS201x v120 toolset**.

----
## 2: A Project based on Ncnn

  https://github.com/moli232777144/mtcnn_ncnn/blob/master/README.md
  
If the envs on your computer can't compatible the **1: A Standalone Project**,the project listed in the above can lead you successfully. There is the guide written in **markdown** to build the project. Following the guide, you can also build ncnn and protobuf as 3rd parties into the project.
